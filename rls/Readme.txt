Uwotmate v1.0

To install the service, open 'Uwotmate.workflow' file and click install.
Uwotmate will be available from the context menu of the selected text.

If you get uncertified developer warning when installing, just cancel, right-click the 'Uwotmate.workflow', click 'Open' and confirm 'OK'.

Should be all good from then on.

Any questions, shoot me an email at michal@csanaky.com or tweet at me @airpoint

Cheers
